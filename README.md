📸 Camera Lens
A 2D Social Media Influence Simulation Game (OCR A-Level Computer Science NEA)
<p align="center"> A narrative-driven browser game exploring how selective photography shapes perception, behaviour, and “clout culture.” </p>
<h2>🎯 Features</h2>
<h3>📷 Interactive Camera System</h3>

Zoom, pan, and capture gameplay events

Flash animation + colour feedback (green = success, red = error)

Every photo broadcasts an event into the world

<h3>🧍 Dynamic NPC Behaviour (Finite State Machines)</h3>

NPC patterns: Idle → Patrol → React

Behaviour shifts only when the player captures specific events

Clean, modular FSM structure

<h3>🔀 Branching Narrative</h3>

Multiple endings (Detention / School Fight / Safe Path)

JSON-based narrative graph

Replayable choices that alter the storyline

<h3>🎨 Sketch-Style Aesthetic</h3>

Lightweight hand-drawn assets

Minimal distractions to focus on choices

Browser-friendly performance

<h3>🔊 Sound & Accessibility</h3>

Master / Music / SFX sliders

Event-based SFX + ambient reactions

Accessible UI feedback

<h3>📱 In-Game Photo Gallery</h3>

Stores all captured photos

Shows history of player decisions

Reinforces the game’s media-literacy theme

<h2>🧩 Technical Architecture</h2>
<h3>📦 Modular, Event-Driven Architecture</h3>

Main Game UI — initialization + loop

Camera Module — capture, zoom, UI states

NPC Module — FSM behaviour transitions

Game State Manager — event triggers + branching

UI Module — camera button, menus, gallery

Sound Module — background music + SFX

<h3>🧠 Computational Techniques</h3>

Abstraction & decomposition

Event-driven programming

Observer Pattern

FSMs for NPC behaviour

JSON narrative graph

Modularised structure for maintainability

<h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>

JavaScript

PixiJS (2D rendering engine)

HTML5 + CSS3

JSON for narrative/data storage

VS Code

Git for version management

<h2>🧪 Testing Strategy</h2>
<h3>Iterative Testing</h3>

Camera zoom limits

High-frequency photo capture

NPC movement/behaviour transitions

UI responsiveness

Event ordering & unexpected inputs

<h3>Post-Development Testing</h3>

Stress testing

Save-data integrity

Usability testing with users

Evaluation against SMART success criteria

<h2>🎓 Educational Purpose</h2>

Camera Lens is designed as a media-literacy tool.
It demonstrates how:

selective photography

attention-driven trends

narrative framing

and digital influence

shape public perception in real life.

Perfect for students, educators, and discussions on social media psychology.
